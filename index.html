 <h1>Michael Cunningham</h1>
 <h2>Senior in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>

 <p>I am a senior at Bob Jones University studying Theatre. I perform regularly and have worked onstage and off stage on several shows.</p>
 <p>
 I enjoy participating in community outreach events, and I am active in my
local church: First Baptist Gowansville, SC. I love to play music during worship services and I hope to be involed in childrens ministry someday soon.
 </p>
 <p>
 I play guitar in my spare time and I love watching films with friends and family.
